 ## Pending issues
I did not manage to "prettify" the frontend to my greatest ability and might revisit this at a later stage.

The tests in the backend still fail and I have still to figure out why. I still believe this to be a problem with a root in not using an entity framework.

## General notes
I find these tasks to be interesting and challenging and would like to commend whoever made them on their creation.

### Note to creator
The naming of the markdown files as stated in the tasks are not corresponding with the expass they are meant to mach with.
